🚀 Excited to share my latest achievement! I just completed the "AI Agents Udemy Course" and earned my certification! 🎉

Over the past 4 days, I built a comprehensive AI chatbot system from scratch, progressing from basic text-based agents to advanced, multi-functional assistants. Here's a quick rundown of my journey:

📅 **Day 1: Basic AI Agents**
- Created text-based chatbots with conversational memory using LangChain and Ollama.
- Developed interactive web UIs with Streamlit for seamless user interaction.

📅 **Day 2: Voice-Powered Assistant**
- Integrated speech recognition and text-to-speech for hands-free operation.
- Built a voice assistant that listens, processes, and responds naturally.

📅 **Day 3: AI Web Scraper with FAISS**
- Developed a web scraper to extract and process online content.
- Incorporated FAISS for efficient vector-based search and enhanced conversational memory.

📅 **Day 4: AI-Powered Document Reader**
- Created a system to read and analyze PDF documents.
- Enabled question-answering based on document content using FAISS for vector storage.

This project showcases the power of local LLMs, modular code design, and practical AI applications. All code is available on my GitHub repo: [link to your repo]

A huge shoutout to @Udemy for the amazing course and to the AI community for the inspiration!
