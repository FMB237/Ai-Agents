# This is mainy our Third projet which has the main aim to create a web scraping AI-Agent
# So the Goal of this day is to build an IA-powered web scarper that can : 
1.Search the web for informations
2.Extract and summarise key content from websites
3.Store scraped data furture reference
4.Works as an autonomous research assistant


# Let install some dependencies
1.Request ▶️ Fetches web page data
2.beautifulsoup4 : Use to Extract and clean text from HTML
3.langchain_ollama : Uses Ollama for AI-powered summarization
4.Streamlit for WEB UI


# Let  Start building our AI-webScarped
On like in other lesson we gonna write a python script
This is mainly done by importing all the modules we have just install

# Let update our AI-Agent by doing the following
1.Storing scraped converted content in a vector database (FAISS)
2.Allowing users to search stored knowledge
3.Retreving relevant content using AI
For all this we gonna install some other dependencies and modified the AI_Web_Scraper code to store data in FAISS
