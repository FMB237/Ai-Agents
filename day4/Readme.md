# The goal for today is to build an IA-Powered Documents Reader
# We will create an IA-Powered documents reader that can perform the following tasks 

1.Read and process Pdf documents
2.That can store document content into a vector database (FAISS)
3.Enable AI to answer questions base on the documents

# Let move on an install the required dependencies to do that 
1.pypdf which is mainly used to read PDFs
2.We gonna also used faiss-cpu to store data into vector form
3.langchain_ollama which runs local IA models
4.langchain_huggingface which used embedded for text speech
5.Streamlit for GUI with AI

# Now the script is been wriiten we can move on to the next step

# Enabling file download and AI-Summarized reports
